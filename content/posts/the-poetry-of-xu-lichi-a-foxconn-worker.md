+++

> By translating these poems, we aim to memorialize Xu, share some of his
> excellent literary work, and spread awareness that the harsh conditions,
> struggles and aspirations of Chinese migrant workers (including but not
> limited to Foxconn) have not diminished since [the more widely-publicized
> spate of 18 attempted Foxconn suicides in
> 2010](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foxconn_suicides), resulting in 14
> deaths. Insiders report that thereafter, although the frequency of suicides
> decreased (mainly due to Foxconn's installation of nets making it more
> difficult for workers to jump from their dormitories, along with the
> development of workers' collective resistance), such suicides have continued
> to the present.  Including Xu Lizhi, at least 8 cases have been reported in
> the media since 2010, but insiders say that many other cases go unreported.
> We hope that in the future, workers in Foxconn and elsewhere manage to find
> ways around such companies' military-style discipline and surveillance, come
> together, and forge collective paths out of this capitalist world of death,
> into a world worth living in. Don't give up!

**On My Deathbed**

I want to take another look at the ocean, behold the vastness of tears from half a lifetime

I want to climb another mountain, try to call back the soul that I’ve lost

I want to touch the sky, feel that blueness so light

But I can’t do any of this, so I’m leaving this world

Everyone who’s heard of me

Shouldn’t be surprised at my leaving

Even less should you sigh or grieve

I was fine when I came, and fine when I left.

-- Xu Lizhi, 30 September 2014
