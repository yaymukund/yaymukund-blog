I told my students in the beginning of the course I would not be talking about the election until the end of the course because this is a class of history. But I guaranteed them that there would be themes every week in the election in the primary battles that linked what happened in January 31, 2008 to discussions of what's happening in Reconstruction America. *These narratives that Glenda [Gilmore] has already alluded to-- white womanhood, the threat of the black male-- these are long, long narratives and I simply can't believe that those narratives are going to disappear.*
