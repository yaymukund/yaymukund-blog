**He to Me or Me to Him\***

<pre class="poem">
When I was translating
twenty years ago
the saints who sang
ten centuries ago about Siva
without any thought of me

I didn't have any
thought of a young man
in Madras ten years ago
who would read them

through my words
night and day
his hand toying with pills
his eyes with colours
turning on a wheel

swallowing them
with the poems
that had no thought
of him or me who had

no thought of him
gaping in the mist
between day and the needles
in the wrist between
to be or not to be

leaving behind poems
for me to read
and to translate this week
without a thought
of him who had thought

of me and the saints
who spoke through me
to him yet had told him
nothing nothing at all
